FEATURES:


Navigation Bar: The navigation bar allows user to navigate through the site swiftly. The formatting is consistent throughout the site. Slight variation of the nav bar in the Image page in order to display images for a more enhanced effect. 

Footer: The footer is displayed consistently throughtout the site on every page. It helps provide added information of the organization, particularly its social media, address and email. 

CSS powered hover effects: added the pulse hover effect on the main menu icons for the navigation bar for users to easily distiguingish which page they have clicked. I also used a shadow hover on the social media links for the same effect. 

Image grid: Users can see an arrange of images quickly to showcase the organisations previous events and people who have been involved.

Bootstrap - The framework was used to create the layout for each page and the nav bar. 

Google Fonts - I used the Gill sans and Calibri fonts on each of my pages.

Font Awesome - I used the font awesome icons to style the nav bar icons and the social media links in the footer.

Various testing was carried out using the developer tools in Google Chrome while in preview from Gitpod in order to check responsiveness and ensuring it is also responsive for mobile devices. Doing so required back-and-forth alterations of code in order to achieve full repsonsiveness for both site and mobile device.
